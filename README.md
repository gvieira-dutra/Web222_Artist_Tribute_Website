# Web222_Artist_Tribute_Website

The first website created for the Web222 class was intended to be a tribute site dedicated to an artist of our choice. 

The main objective of this project was to apply fundamental web programming principles. These included embedding images, videos, and audio files, as well as incorporating hyperlinks to redirect users to external websites. 

Additionally, the website featured multiple pages and a user-friendly menu to facilitate easy navigation.

You can check the website on the following link:
